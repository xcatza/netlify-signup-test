# Netlify Identity Test

Testing `identity-signup` trigger to automatically add the role `basic-user` to all sign-ups.

Using [The role of roles and how to set them in Netlify Identity](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/02/21/the-role-of-roles-and-how-to-set-them-in-netlify-identity/).

Inspired to test this out by [Automatically assigning roles on sign up event with serverless function](https://answers.netlify.com/t/automatically-assigning-roles-on-sign-up-event-with-serverless-function/50763)
